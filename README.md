### Rock Paper Scissors
---
this game was created by 2 friends (with the help of AI).
---
this is made out of: <br>
- HTML, 
- CSS  
- Vanilla JS
---
The cool thing is that the game is fair because the choice of the computer is random,
and if you hover over your choices there is a nice colorchanging effect.
---
have fun! :)
